| `Quit app after media sync`            | If enabled, this option will automatically quit M¬≥ 5 seconds after the media sync is complete. <br><br> *To prevent M¬≥ from quitting automatically when this setting is enabled, press the üèÉ (person leaving/running) button before the 5-second timer is up.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `Enable OBS Studio compatibility mode` | If enabled, this option will tap into OBS Studio to change scenes automatically as needed both before and after sharing media. <br><br> *If enabling this setting, make sure that OBS Studio is configured to use the `obs-websocket` plugin, which is what will enable M¬≥ to communicate with OBS Studio. <br><br> Also, configure all needed scenes for media sharing and stage display in OBS. At the very least, you'll need a scene with a `Window Capture` (recommended) or `Display Capture` configured to capture the M¬≥ media presentation window, or the screen on which the media will be presented. <br><br> You'll also need to configure all desired stage view scenes, for example: a shot of the lecturn, a wide shot of the stage, etc.* |

### Einstellungen: Versammlungs-Synchronisierung

See the [Congregation sync]({{page.lang}}/#congregation-sync) section for details on what this does exactly and how to configure this section.

### Einstellungen: Medien

This will automatically convert all picture and audio files into MP4 format, for use with Zoom's [native MP4 sharing feature](assets/img/other/zoom-mp4-share.png) during fully remote congregation Zoom meetings. This includes all pictures and media files downloaded from JW.org, as well as additional media files added by the user or the VO. If conducting either **hybrid** or **regular** congregation meetings, look into using [Media Presentation mode]({{page.lang}}/#present-media) by activating the `Present media on an external monitor or in a separate window` option instead, and disable this option.</em> <br><br> ***Note:** This option is best suited for **remote-only** congregation Zoom meetings.</td> </tr>

| `Automatically stop playing songs`               | If `Enable button to play Kingdom songs on shuffle` is active, then this setting will allow you to specify a delay after which background music should be automatically stopped.
