### Är den här appen beroende av externa sajter eller källor för att ladda ner publikationer och mötesmedia?

**No.** The app behaves similarly to JW Library. It downloads publications and media directly from the official JW.org website and its content delivery network. At runtime, the app automatically determines what needs to be downloaded, such as media files and publications. The source code is available for all to examine and verify this.

### Bryter den här appen mot JW.orgs användarvillkor?

**No.** The JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/finder?docid=1011511&prefer=content) actually explicitly allow the kind of usage that we are making. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms (emphasis mine):

> Du får inte:
>

(This does **not** prohibit the distribution of free, non-commercial applications designed to download electronic files such as EPUB, PDF, MP3, and MP4 files from public areas of this site.)
